# calculator
A simple Apple caluclator copy for The Odin Project

**Current Bugs
-Percent button does not automatically show solution when used on second number input (like Apple's version)
-Upon clicking solution, user must click AC/C button before entering new values.

When user clicks '=': 
- if next input is number: starts a new equation
- if next input is operator: chains to previous solution

Nice to have
-Border appers when operator is selected
-add backspace button
-add keyboard support
